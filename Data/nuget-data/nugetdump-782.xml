      <Description>Allows inspecting the exact type inheritance tree as declared in source, rather than the flattened view that reflection provides (for implemented interfaces, for example).

Enables code to determine what are the interfaces implemented directly by a type rather than a base class, as well as determine the "distance" in the hierarchy to those implementations.

var tree = typeof(Window).GetInheritanceTree();

// Gets just the base class ContentControl, instead 
// of that plus 9 interfaces implemented on base types
Assert.Equal(1, tree.Inheritance.Count);
Assert.Equal(typeof(ContentControl), tree.Inheritance.First().Type);</Description>

      <Description>This is not only a substance to preserve rebel pilots!

Carbonite includes a new lightweight ORM capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code. Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.

KEYSTONE is a modern, multi-paradigm, data-centric software development framework. Visit http://www.keystoneframework.com for more details.</Description>

      <Description>This is not only a substance to preserve rebel pilots!

Carbonite includes a new lightweight ORM capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code. Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.

KEYSTONE is a modern, multi-paradigm, data-centric software development framework. Visit http://www.keystoneframework.com for more details.</Description>

      <Description>This is not only a substance to preserve rebel pilots!

Carbonite includes a new lightweight ORM capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code. Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.

KEYSTONE is a modern, multi-paradigm, data-centric software development framework. Visit http://www.keystoneframework.com for more details.</Description>

      <Description>This is not only a substance to preserve rebel pilots!

Carbonite includes a new lightweight ORM capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code. Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.

KEYSTONE is a modern, multi-paradigm, data-centric software development framework. Visit http://www.keystoneframework.com for more details.</Description>

      <Description>This is not only a substance to preserve rebel pilots!

Carbonite includes a new lightweight ORM capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code. Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.

KEYSTONE is a modern, multi-paradigm, data-centric software development framework. Visit http://www.keystoneframework.com for more details.</Description>

      <Description>This is not only a substance to preserve rebel pilots!

Carbonite includes a new lightweight ORM capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code. Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.

KEYSTONE is a modern, multi-paradigm, data-centric software development framework. Visit http://www.keystoneframework.com for more details.</Description>

      <Description>This is not only a substance to preserve rebel pilots!

Carbonite includes a new lightweight ORM capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code. Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.

      <Description>This is not only a substance to preserve rebel pilots!

Carbonite includes a new lightweight ORM capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code. Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so that you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.

KEYSTONE is a modern, multi-paradigm, data-centric software development framework. Visit http://www.keystoneframework.com for more details.</Description>

      <Description>This is not only a substance to preserve rebel pilots!

Carbonite includes a new lightweight ORM capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code. Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so that you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.

      <Description>This is not only a substance to preserve rebel pilots!

Carbonite includes a new lightweight ORM capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code. Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so that you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.

KEYSTONE is a modern, multi-paradigm, data-centric software development framework. Visit http://www.keystoneframework.com for more details.</Description>

      <Description>This component has foundation classes for the new lightweight Carbonite ORM, capable of mapping your objects and database by convention, configuration or code.

Carbonite also conceals other popular ORMs into the same programming model so you will never need to deal again with hard-to-maintain heterogeneous data layers implementation models.
