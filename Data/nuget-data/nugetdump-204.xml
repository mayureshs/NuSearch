      <Description>Fully asynchronous Redis client, capable of pipelined operations; this acts as a multiplexer, allowing high-performance parallel usage of a single connection (or few connections) without being blocked on each separate request. All core redis opeations are supported. This library can also be used from C# 5.0/async very effectively.</Description>

      <Description>Fully asynchronous Redis client, capable of pipelined operations; this acts as a multiplexer, allowing high-performance parallel usage of a single connection (or few connections) without being blocked on each separate request. All core redis opeations are supported. This library can also be used from C# 5.0/async very effectively.</Description>

      <Description>Fully asynchronous Redis client, capable of pipelined operations; this acts as a multiplexer, allowing high-performance parallel usage of a single connection (or few connections) without being blocked on each separate request. All core redis opeations are supported. This library can also be used from C# 5.0/async very effectively.</Description>

      <ReleaseNotes>First Nuget version, last features include:
- Configuration Tab shows entire config XML file (not just application section)
- Configuration Tab shows XML file in formatted HTML
- Added Less/More detail button - toggles between showing just the exception message or the dialog as normal (for users who get confused with too much information)
- Support for multiple exceptions (ie a list of exceptions)
- A custom message can override the main message (ie Exception.Message)
    Screenshot saved in jpeg (rather than .bmp) to reduce file size
- New API exposed, so that programmers can create a report, programatically, without showing a dialog (see ExceptionReportGenerator class)
- AppVersion and AppName config properties can now be set manually - previously, although they were public properties, they would be forcibly overriden by ExceptionReporter as part of gathering application/system properties</ReleaseNotes>

      <ReleaseNotes>New Feature:

Automatically compress all files that are specified for attachment into a single zip file (excluding files already with .zip extension)

Fixes/Changes:

Fix SMTP support including adding SSL/credentials and to be properly configurable via code. Also added specific SMTP error display for diagnosis
Removed XML config in favor of code config. The "Config" tab is also therefore removed. The idea here would be that you'll either hardcode some values and/or derive some from your own App config.

Internal/structural:

Removed embedded Win32Mapi library and switched to using a nuget dependency to include support for Simple-MAPI.NET ie for using embedded email client for emails
The base .NET runtime is 4.0 Client
The assembly is no longer signed - if I could figure out a way to provide signed/unsigned I would do it - let me know if being unsigned is a hassle
Removed the WPF infrastructure - the code that used reflection to determine whether the assembly was WPF/Winforms was of no use since the WPF version did not get worked on. There will be some kind of performance boost from removing this</ReleaseNotes>

      <Description>Fully asynchronous Redis client, capable of pipelined operations; this acts as a multiplexer, allowing high-performance parallel usage of a single connection (or few connections) without being blocked on each separate request. All core redis opeations are supported. This library can also be used from C# 5.0/async very effectively.</Description>

      <Description>Fully asynchronous Redis client, capable of pipelined operations; this acts as a multiplexer, allowing high-performance parallel usage of a single connection (or few connections) without being blocked on each separate request. All core redis opeations are supported. This library can also be used from C# 5.0/async very effectively.</Description>

      <Description>Fully asynchronous Redis client, capable of pipelined operations; this acts as a multiplexer, allowing high-performance parallel usage of a single connection (or few connections) without being blocked on each separate request. All core redis opeations are supported. This library can also be used from C# 5.0/async very effectively.</Description>

      <Description>A simple implementation of IValueConverter that inverts (negates) boolean values. In addition, it can process an additional IValueConverter instance that is passed as ConverterParameter and calls this converter's Convert method before or after the inverting operation, depending on whether the additional converter expects a boolean value as input, or produces a boolean value as output.</Description>

      <Description>A simple implementation of IValueConverter that inverts (negates) boolean values. In addition, it can process an additional IValueConverter instance that is passed as ConverterParameter and calls this converter's Convert method before or after the inverting operation, depending on whether the additional converter expects a boolean value as input, or produces a boolean value as output.</Description>
