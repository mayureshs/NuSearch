      <Description>MediaTypeFormatter allowing the use of YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) as a the MIME-Type or content-type in ASP.NET Web API.  Both serialization and deserialization are supported allowing web services to both emit and accept YAML in place of XML or JSON.

        The underlying YAML parsing and rendering function is provided by Antoine Aubry's excellent YamlDotNet, as such it is possible to configure the serialization and deserialization process through a series of public properties on the MediaTypeFormatter.

        YAML is described as "a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages".  Like XML, it allows to represent about any kind of data in a portable, platform-independent format.  Unlike XML, it is "human friendly", which means that it is easy for a human to read or produce a valid YAML document.

        MediaTypeFormatters are .NET Classes that allow you to accept and emit different media types using ASP.NET Web API.  Out of the box Web API includes support for JSON, BSON and XML, additional Media Types can be added through MediaTypeFormatters.

      <Description>MediaTypeFormatter allowing the use of YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) as a the MIME-Type or content-type in ASP.NET Web API.  Both serialization and deserialization are supported allowing web services to both emit and accept YAML in place of XML or JSON.

The underlying YAML parsing and rendering function is provided by Antoine Aubry's excellent YamlDotNet, as such it is possible to configure the serialization and deserialization process through a series of public properties on the MediaTypeFormatter.

YAML is described as "a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages".  Like XML, it allows to represent about any kind of data in a portable, platform-independent format.  Unlike XML, it is "human friendly", which means that it is easy for a human to read or produce a valid YAML document.

MediaTypeFormatters are .NET Classes that allow you to accept and emit different media types using ASP.NET Web API.  Out of the box Web API includes support for JSON, BSON and XML, additional Media Types can be added through MediaTypeFormatters.

      <Description>MediaTypeFormatter allowing the use of YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) as a the MIME-Type or content-type in ASP.NET Web API.  Both serialization and deserialization are supported allowing web services to both emit and accept YAML in place of XML or JSON.

The underlying YAML parsing and rendering function is provided by Antoine Aubry's excellent YamlDotNet, as such it is possible to configure the serialization and deserialization process through a series of public properties on the MediaTypeFormatter.

YAML is described as "a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages".  Like XML, it allows to represent about any kind of data in a portable, platform-independent format.

      <Description>MediaTypeFormatter allowing the use of YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) as a the MIME-Type or content-type in ASP.NET Web API.  Both serialization and deserialization are supported allowing web services to both emit and accept YAML in place of XML or JSON.

The underlying YAML parsing and rendering function is provided by Antoine Aubry's excellent YamlDotNet, as such it is possible to configure the serialization and deserialization process through a series of public properties on the MediaTypeFormatter.

YAML is described as "a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages".  Like XML, it allows to represent about any kind of data in a portable, platform-independent format.  Unlike XML, it is "human friendly", which means that it is easy for a human to read or produce a valid YAML document.

MediaTypeFormatters are .NET Classes that allow you to accept and emit different media types using ASP.NET Web API.  Out of the box Web API includes support for JSON, BSON and XML, additional Media Types can be added through MediaTypeFormatters.

      <Description>MediaTypeFormatter allowing the use of YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) as a the MIME-Type or content-type in ASP.NET Web API.  Both serialization and deserialization are supported allowing web services to both emit and accept YAML in place of XML or JSON.

The underlying YAML parsing and rendering function is provided by Antoine Aubry's excellent YamlDotNet, as such it is possible to configure the serialization and deserialization process through a series of public properties on the MediaTypeFormatter.

YAML is described as "a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages".  Like XML, it allows to represent about any kind of data in a portable, platform-independent format.  Unlike XML, it is "human friendly", which means that it is easy for a human to read or produce a valid YAML document.

MediaTypeFormatters are .NET Classes that allow you to accept and emit different media types using ASP.NET Web API.  Out of the box Web API includes support for JSON, BSON and XML, additional Media Types can be added through MediaTypeFormatters.

      <Description>MediaTypeFormatter allowing the use of YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) as a the MIME-Type or content-type in ASP.NET Web API.  Both serialization and deserialization are supported allowing web services to both emit and accept YAML in place of XML or JSON.

The underlying YAML parsing and rendering function is provided by Antoine Aubry's excellent YamlDotNet, as such it is possible to configure the serialization and deserialization process through a series of public properties on the MediaTypeFormatter.

YAML is described as "a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages".  Like XML, it allows to represent about any kind of data in a portable, platform-independent format.  Unlike XML, it is "human friendly", which means that it is easy for a human to read or produce a valid YAML document.

MediaTypeFormatters are .NET Classes that allow you to accept and emit different media types using ASP.NET Web API.  Out of the box Web API includes support for JSON, BSON and XML, additional Media Types can be added through MediaTypeFormatters.

      <Description>MediaTypeFormatter allowing the use of YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) as a the MIME-Type or content-type in ASP.NET Web API.  Both serialization and deserialization are supported allowing web services to both emit and accept YAML in place of XML or JSON.

The underlying YAML parsing and rendering function is provided by Antoine Aubry's excellent YamlDotNet, as such it is possible to configure the serialization and deserialization process through a series of public properties on the MediaTypeFormatter.

YAML is described as "a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages".  Like XML, it allows to represent about any kind of data in a portable, platform-independent format.  Unlike XML, it is "human friendly", which means that it is easy for a human to read or produce a valid YAML document.

MediaTypeFormatters are .NET Classes that allow you to accept and emit different media types using ASP.NET Web API.  Out of the box Web API includes support for JSON, BSON and XML, additional Media Types can be added through MediaTypeFormatters.

      <ReleaseNotes>Version 3.0
This Version has a new build in Validation Engine. This Engine is a replacement of the former used HashTables with Validation support. The new Validation Engine offers additional Validation and Repair Options and manages Cross references between CAEX-Elements. The Old HashTables are still available to be downward compatibel.

In Version 3.0 the most Element Creation and Insertion Methods are provided with an additional Parameter that allows the explicit definition, wether a new Element is inserted as the first Element of it's Type or the Last Element of it's Type in the Children Collection of it's Parent. The Default Behavior has not changed to former versions, where the Insertion Position in most methods was the first.





Version 2.2 
This version uses an updated Altova Kernel

Better Performance when large Trees are
walked. Use of Recursion is avoided for those walks. The .Net 4.0 Version uses Parallel for Consistency Checks.
------------------------------------------

Version 2.1.5

Method to redirect links for mirrors and internal links complete redesigned for better performance.

Referencing of CAEX Elementnames which contain special characters (i.e. in InternalLinks) are now handled as defined in the CAEX guide. 

New Methods two get derived Interfaces and derived SupportedRoleClasses (similar to the Method to get derived Attributes).</ReleaseNotes>

      <ReleaseNotes>Version 3.0.3
Bug Fixes

Version 3.0
This Version has a new build in Validation Engine. This Engine is a replacement of the former used HashTables with Validation support. The new Validation Engine offers additional Validation and Repair Options and manages Cross references between CAEX-Elements. The Old HashTables are still available to be downward compatibel.

In Version 3.0 the most Element Creation and Insertion Methods are provided with an additional Parameter that allows the explicit definition, wether a new Element is inserted as the first Element of it's Type or the Last Element of it's Type in the Children Collection of it's Parent. The Default Behavior has not changed to former versions, where the Insertion Position in most methods was the first.





Version 2.2 
This version uses an updated Altova Kernel

Better Performance when large Trees are
walked. Use of Recursion is avoided for those walks. The .Net 4.0 Version uses Parallel for Consistency Checks.
------------------------------------------

Version 2.1.5

Method to redirect links for mirrors and internal links complete redesigned for better performance.

Referencing of CAEX Elementnames which contain special characters (i.e. in InternalLinks) are now handled as defined in the CAEX guide. 

New Methods two get derived Interfaces and derived SupportedRoleClasses (similar to the Method to get derived Attributes).</ReleaseNotes>

Version 3.1
Official Release Version of the AMLEngine

Version 3.0.3
Bug Fixes


Version 3.0
This Version has a new build in Validation Engine. This Engine is a replacement of the former used HashTables with Validation support. The new Validation Engine offers additional Validation and Repair Options and manages Cross references between CAEX-Elements. The Old HashTables are still available to be downward compatibel.

In Version 3.0 the most Element Creation and Insertion Methods are provided with an additional Parameter that allows the explicit definition, wether a new Element is inserted as the first Element of it's Type or the Last Element of it's Type in the Children Collection of it's Parent. The Default Behavior has not changed to former versions, where the Insertion Position in most methods was the first.





Version 2.2 
This version uses an updated Altova Kernel

Better Performance when large Trees are
walked. Use of Recursion is avoided for those walks. The .Net 4.0 Version uses Parallel for Consistency Checks.
------------------------------------------

Version 2.1.5

Method to redirect links for mirrors and internal links complete redesigned for better performance.

Referencing of CAEX Elementnames which contain special characters (i.e. in InternalLinks) are now handled as defined in the CAEX guide. 

New Methods two get derived Interfaces and derived SupportedRoleClasses (similar to the Method to get derived Attributes).</ReleaseNotes>

New Methods to set and get Attribute Values with their .net DataType. For this, the xsd-Schema type is mapped to a .net DataType and a string conversion is performed. The CAEX Wrapper Type AttributeType provides get and set Methods for Double and DateTime - Types and a generic get Method, which tries to apply a string to type conversion for any of the xsd-Schema-Types if the type information is defined in the AttributeDataType-Field. The FrameAttribute Type does no longer use the FormatInformation - this property is obsolete. See documentation of methods for details.

Version 3.2
Frame attribute default format is "." as decimal separator and 2 decimal digits. Change this with FormatInformation in FrameAttributeType.

In Version 3.0 the most Element Creation and Insertion Methods are provided with an additional Parameter that allows the explicit definition, wether a new Element is inserted as the first Element of it's Type or the Last Element of it's Type in the Children Collection of it's Parent. The Default Behavior has not changed to former versions, where the Insertion Position in most methods was the first.





Version 2.2 
This version uses an updated Altova Kernel

Better Performance when large Trees are
walked. Use of Recursion is avoided for those walks. The .Net 4.0 Version uses Parallel for Consistency Checks.
------------------------------------------

Version 2.1.5

Method to redirect links for mirrors and internal links complete redesigned for better performance.

Referencing of CAEX Elementnames which contain special characters (i.e. in InternalLinks) are now handled as defined in the CAEX guide. 

New Methods two get derived Interfaces and derived SupportedRoleClasses (similar to the Method to get derived Attributes).</ReleaseNotes>

      <ReleaseNotes>Version 3.2.6
Externaly referenced AML-Documents can be loaded into the DOM with the method &lt;ExternalInterfaceType.LoadOrGetReferencedDocument&gt;. The loaded referenced documents are connected to the main document and are used in the Find... Methods.

Version 3.2.5
Bugfix for method InternalElementType.CreateSystemUnitClass 

Accessors for Subattributes of  FrameAttributeType added.

Version 3.2.4
Error in Initialization of FrameValues corrected and Frame DataType set to null.

Version 3.2.1 - correction of 3.2.0 changes
New Methods to set and get Attribute Values with their .net DataType. For this, the xsd-Schema type is mapped to a .net DataType and a string conversion is performed. The CAEX Wrapper Type AttributeType provides get and set Methods for Double and DateTime - Types and a generic get Method, which tries to apply a string to type conversion for any of the xsd-Schema-Types if the type information is defined in the AttributeDataType-Field. The FrameAttribute Type does no longer use the FormatInformation - this property is obsolete. See documentation of methods for details.

Version 3.2
Frame attribute default format is "." as decimal separator and 2 decimal digits. Change this with FormatInformation in FrameAttributeType.

bugs in validation engine fixed

missing wrapper creation methods for some types are added.

Version 3.1.4
CAEXPath Method returns wrong path for ExternalInterface
Property ManagedByApplication of CAEXTables renamed due to spelling error
Overload Methods for CaexBasicObject.Descendants (additional parameter for create delegate), avoids reflection.

Version 3.1.3
Increased Performance when accessing Object Tables

Version 3.1.2
new method to create InternalLinks and ExternalInterfaceClasses together: 
public static InternalLinkType CreateInternalLink

Version 3.1.1
Bug-Fix in RefURIAttributeType

Version 3.1
Official Release Version of the AMLEngine

Version 3.0.3

      <ReleaseNotes>The AMLEngine is now able to handle different GUID String representations in the same Document, as longs as the representation can be parsed into a valid GUID. The affected components in the AMLEngine are the Tables in the Validation Namespace which make a Key-Transformation before accessing items in the Dictionary. If you directly use the KeyCollection of a table, please not that all the Keys are normalized.</ReleaseNotes>
